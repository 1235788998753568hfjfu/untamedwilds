            "text": "A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It is the only living species of the order Tubulidentata, although other prehistoric species and genera of Tubulidentata are known. It receives a \"least concern\" rating from the IUCN, although its numbers seem to be decreasing. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. Aardvarks are afrotheres, a clade which also includes elephants, manatees, and hyraxes. The aardvark ( ARD-vark; Orycteropus afer) is a medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa. It roams over most of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky."
