            "text": "They have several other common names, including Asian bonytongue, dragonfish, and a number of names specific to the different color varieties. Adults feed on other fish, while juveniles feed on insects.These popular aquarium fish have special cultural significance in areas influenced by Chinese culture. The Asian arowana (Scleropages formosus) comprises several phenotypic varieties of freshwater fish distributed geographically across Southeast Asia. While most consider the different varieties to belong to a single species, work by Pouyaud et al. (2003) differentiates these varieties into multiple species. Native to Southeast Asia, Asian arowanas inhabit blackwater rivers, slow-moving waters flowing through forested swamps and wetlands. This popularity has had both positive and negative effects on their status as endangered species."
