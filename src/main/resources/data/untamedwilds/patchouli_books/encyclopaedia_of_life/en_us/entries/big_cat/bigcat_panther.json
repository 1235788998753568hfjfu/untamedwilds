            "text": "The earliest known leopard fossils excavated in Europe are estimated 600,000 years old, dating to the late Early Pleistocene. It is similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed and without central spots. The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in Morocco, leopard populations have already been extirpated. Leopard fossils were also found in Japan. Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers."
