            "text": "The bluntnose sixgill is a specific species of sixgill sharks, of genus Hexanchus, a genus that also consists of another species: the bigeye sixgill shark (Hexanchus nakamurai). The bluntnose sixgill shark (Hexanchus griseus), often simply called the cow shark, is the largest hexanchoid shark, growing to 20 ft (6.1 m) in length. Through their base pairs of mitochondrial genes COI and ND2, these two species of sixgills widely differ from one another. It is found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide and its diet is widely varied by region."
