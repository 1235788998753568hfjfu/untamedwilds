            "text": "This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flat snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor and in the middle of the water column. The goblin shark (Mitsukurina owstoni) is a rare species of deep-sea shark. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. Sometimes called a \"living fossil\", it is the only extant representative of the family Mitsukurinidae, a lineage some 125 million years old. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture."
