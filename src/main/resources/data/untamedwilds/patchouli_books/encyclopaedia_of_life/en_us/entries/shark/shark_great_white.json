            "text": "According to the same study, male great white sharks take 26 years to reach sexual maturity, while the females take 33 years to be ready to produce offspring. The IUCN lists the great white shark as a vulnerable species, and it is included in Appendix II of CITES. This shark is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, including fish, and seabirds. It is arguably the world's largest-known extant macropredatory fish, and is one of the primary predators of marine mammals, up to the size of large baleen whales. Although attempts have been made to do so in the past, there are no known aquariums in the world believed to house one. However, most are smaller; males measure 3.4 to 4.0 m (11 to 13 ft), and females measure 4.6 to 4.9 m (15 to 16 ft) on average. It is notable for its size, with larger female individuals growing to 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and 1,905\u20132,268 kg (4,200\u20135,000 lb) in weight at maturity."
