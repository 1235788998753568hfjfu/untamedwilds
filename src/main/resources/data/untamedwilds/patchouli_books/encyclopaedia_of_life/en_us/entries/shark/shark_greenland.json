            "text": "The Greenland shark has the longest known lifespan of all vertebrate species (estimated to be between 300 and 500 years), and is among the largest extant species of shark. Greenland shark flesh, treated to reduce toxin levels, is eaten in Iceland as a delicacy known as k\u00e6stur h\u00e1karl. As an adaptation to living at depth, it has a high concentration of trimethylamine N-oxide in its tissues, which causes the meat to be toxic. The distribution of this species is mostly restricted to the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean and Arctic Ocean. It is a generalist feeder, consuming a variety of available foods."
