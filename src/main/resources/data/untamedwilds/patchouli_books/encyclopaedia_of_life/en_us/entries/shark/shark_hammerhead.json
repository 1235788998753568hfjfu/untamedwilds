            "text": "The scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. The Greek word sphyrna translates into \"hammer\" in English, referring to the shape of this shark's head. This shark is also known as the bronze, kinky-headed, or southern hammerhead. It is a fairly large hammerhead, but is still smaller than both the great and smooth hammerheads. Originally known as Zygaena lewini, its genus name was later changed to its current name. The most distinguishing characteristic of this shark, as in all hammerheads, is the 'hammer' on its head. It primarily lives in warm, temperate, and tropical coastal waters all around the globe between latitudes 46\u00b0N and 36\u00b0S, down to a depth of 500 m (1,600 ft)."
