            "text": "The lemon shark's life span is unknown, but the average shark is 25 to 30 years old. Lemon sharks enjoy the many benefits of group living such as enhanced communication, courtship, predatory behavior, and protection. This species of shark gives birth to live young, and the females are polyandrous and have a biennial reproductive cycle. Often feeding at night, these sharks use electroreceptors to find their main source of prey: fish. They are often found in shallow subtropical waters and are known to inhabit and return to specific nursery sites for breeding. Lemon sharks can grow to 3.4 metres (11 ft) in length. Lemon sharks are not thought to be a large threat to humans."
