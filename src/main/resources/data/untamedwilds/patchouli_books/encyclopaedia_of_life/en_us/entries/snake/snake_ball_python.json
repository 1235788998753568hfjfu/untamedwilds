The name \"ball python\" refers to its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened. This nonvenomous constrictor is the smallest of the African pythons, growing to a maximum length of 182 cm (72 in). It is threatened by hunting for its meat and for the international pet trade. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution."
