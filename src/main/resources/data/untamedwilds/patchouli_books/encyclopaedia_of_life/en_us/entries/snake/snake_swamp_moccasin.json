            "text": "Common names include variants on cottonmouth, water moccasin, swamp moccasin, black moccasin, and simply viper. It is the only venomous species of North America's water snakes, and one of twenty one venomous snakes in the United States. Agkistrodon piscivorus is a species of pit viper in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. It occurs in or near water, particularly in slow-moving and shallow lakes, streams, and marshes. Three subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. As an adult, it is large and capable of delivering a painful and potentially fatal bite. When threatened, it may respond by coiling its body and displaying its fangs."
