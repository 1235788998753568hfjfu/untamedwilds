Mexican redknee tarantulas are a popular choice as pets among tarantula keepers. Brachypelma smithi is a species of spider in the family Theraphosidae (tarantulas) native to Mexico. B. smithi is a terrestrial tarantula native to Pacific coast of the Mexican state of Guerrero. It has been confused with Brachypelma hamorii; both have been called Mexican redknee tarantulas."
