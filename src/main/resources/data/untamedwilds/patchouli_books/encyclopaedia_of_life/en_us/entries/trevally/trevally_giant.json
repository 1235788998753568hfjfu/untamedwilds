            "text": "The giant trevally employs novel hunting strategies, including shadowing monk seals to pick off escaping prey, as well as using sharks to ambush prey. The giant trevally is an apex predator in most of its habitats, and is known to hunt individually and in schools. The species predominantly takes various fish as prey, although crustaceans, cephalopods and molluscs make up a considerable part of their diets in some regions. The giant trevally reproduces in the warmer months, with peaks differing by region. Juveniles of the species are known to live in waters of very low salinity such as coastal lakes and upper reaches of rivers, and tend to prefer turbid waters. The species is considered poor to excellent table fare by different authors, although ciguatera poisoning is common from eating the fish. Catch statistics in the Asian region show hauls of 4,000\u201310,000 tonnes, while around 10,000 lbs of the species is taken in Hawaii each year."
