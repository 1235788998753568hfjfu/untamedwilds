            "text": "The golden trevally is a popular gamefish, taken by bait, lure, fly and also spear throughout its range. The golden trevally schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range. Several Asian countries currently farm the fish in caged aquaculture. Due to their brilliant colouration, juveniles are popular in marine aquaria."
